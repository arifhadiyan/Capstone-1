# Capstone-1

In this project, I've developed "Grocery Store Management System", a mini application for managing grocery stock and purchase transactions. This program enables users to handle tasks related to grocery management, such as viewing, adding, and removing items from the inventory, as well as facilitating the purchasing process.

Here's an explanation of the features in the grocery store program from menu 1 to menu 5. With these features, users can view the list of available groceries, add or remove groceries from the list, purchase groceries, and exit the program.

Menu 1: Display Grocery List

Feature: Display the list of available groceries along with their stock and prices.
Implementation: It uses the display_grocery_list() function to show the grocery list.

Menu 2: Add Grocery

Feature: Allow users to add new groceries to the list.
Implementation: It uses the add_grocery() function to prompt users to input the name, stock, and price of the new grocery, and then adds it to the list.

Menu 3: Remove Grocery

Feature: Allow users to remove existing groceries from the list.
Implementation: It uses the remove_grocery() function to prompt users to input the name of the grocery they want to remove, and then removes it from the list if it exists.

Menu 4: Update Grocery

Feature: Allow users to update existing groceries from the list.
Implementation: It uses the update_grocery() function to prompt users to input the name of the grocery they want to update, and then updates the stock and the price.

Menu 5: Search grocery
Feature: Allow users to search for a specific grocery item by name and display its details (stock and price). 
Implementation: It uses the search_grocery () function to prompt users to input the name of the grocery they want to search, and then display its stock and price.

Menu 6: Buy Grocery

Feature: Allow users to purchase groceries from the list.
Implementation: It uses the buy_grocery() function to prompt users to input the grocery they want to buy along with the quantity, adds it to the shopping cart, calculates the total payment, and completes the payment process.

Menu 6: Exit program

Feature: Exit the program.
Implementation: It ends the program after the user selects the exit menu.
